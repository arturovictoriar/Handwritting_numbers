# Handwritting numbers Training

## Description
This project is about identifing images related to handwriting numbers using keras and mnist databases

## Usage

1. Execute the file handwriting for training the model using convolutiona NN

```console
foo@bar:~$ ~/Handwritting_numbers/backend/training$ ./handwriting_model.py
```

2. Evaluate the probality to identify a number with previous model

```console
foo@bar:~$ ~/Handwritting_numbers/backend/training$ ./test_evaluate_handwriting.py
```

3. Predict a given image

```console
foo@bar:~$ ~/Handwritting_numbers/backend/training$ ./test_predict_handwriting.py
```

### Note: You can change the image to predict modifing the variable "img_predict" in the test_predict_handwriting.py file
